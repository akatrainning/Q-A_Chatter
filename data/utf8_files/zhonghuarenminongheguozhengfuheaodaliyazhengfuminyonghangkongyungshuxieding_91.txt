dered  valid  pursuant  to,and  in  conformity  with,the  standards  established  un-
der  the  Convention.Each  Contracting  Party  reserves  the  right,however,to  re-

rendered valid by one Contracting Party permit a difference from the standards

ting  Party  under  Article  8(Safety),paragraph  2,request  consultations  in  ac-
cordance with Article  17(Consultations)of this  Agreement  with the  aeronauti-

ing safety standards in any area relating to airerew,aircraft or their operation a-
dopted by the other Contracting Party.Such consultations shal take place with-
鈥�9鈥�
in 30 days of that request.
銆€銆€銆€銆€2.If,following  such  consultations,one  Contracting  Party  finds  that  the other  Contracting  Party  does  not  effectively  maintain  and  administer  safety    standards in any such area that are at least equal to the minimum standards es-    tablished  at that time pursuant to the  Convention,the  first  Contracting  Party    shall notify the other Contracting Party of those findings and the steps consid-    ered necessary to conform with those minimum standards,and that other Con-
tracting Party shall take appropriate corrective action.Failure by the other Con- tracting Party to take appropriate action within 15 days or such longer period as may be agreed,shall be grounds for the application of paragraph 1 of Article 5 (Revocation and Limitation of Authorization)of this Agreement.
銆€銆€銆€3.Notwithstanding the obligations mentioned in Article 33 of the Conven- tion,it is agreed that any aircraft operated by the airline or airlines of one Con- tracting Party on services to or from the territory of another Contracting Party may,while within the territory of the other Contracting Party,be made the sub- ject of any examination by the authorized representatives of the other Contrac- ting Party,on board and around the aircraft to check both the validity of the aircraft documents and those of its crew and the apparent condition of the air- craft   and   its   equipment(in   this  Article   called"ramp   inspection"),provided this does not lead to unreasonable delay.
4.If any such ramp inspection or series of ramp inspections gives rise to:
銆€銆€銆€a)serious concerns that an aircraft or the operation of an aircraft does not comply with the minimum standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention,or
銆€銆€銆€b)serious concerns that there is a lack of effective maintenance and ad- ministration of safety standards established at that time pursuant to the Conven-
tion,
銆€銆€銆€the Contracting Party carrying out the inspection shall,for the purposes of Article 33 of the Convention,be free to conclude that the requirements under which the certificate or licenses in respect of that aircraft or in respect of the crew of that aircraft had been issued or rendered valid,or that the requirements under which that aircraft is operated,are not equal to or above the minimum standards established pursuant to the Convention.
銆€銆€銆€5.In the event that access for the purpose of undertaking a ramp inspec- tion of an aircraft operated by the airline or airlines of one Contracting Party in accordance with paragraph 3 above is denied by the representative of that air- line  or  airlines,the  other  Contracting  Party  shall  be  free  to  infer  that  serious concerns of the type referred to in paragraph 4 above arise and draw the conclu- sions referred to in that paragraph.
銆€銆€銆€6.Each Contracting Party reserves the right to suspend or vary the operat- ing authorization of an airline or airlines of the other Contracting Party immedi- ately in the event the first Contracting Party concludes,whether as a result of access for ramp inspection,a series of ramp inspections,a denial of access for ramp  inspection,consultation  or  otherwise,that  immediate  action  is  essentia to the safety of an airline operation.
銆€銆€銆€7.Any action by one Contracting Party in accordance with paragraphs 2 or 6 above shall be discontinued once the basis for the taking of that action ceases to  exist.
ARTICLE 9

銆€銆€銆€2.The  Contracting  Parties  shall  provide  upon  request  all  necessary  assis- tance to each other to prevent acts of unlawful seizure of civil  aircraft and other  unlawful  acts  against  the  safety  of  such  aircraft,their  passengers  and  crew,air-  ports and air navigation facilities,and any other threat to  security  of civil avia-  tion.
銆€銆€銆€3.The  Contracting  Parties  shall  act  in  conformity  with  the  aviation  securi- ty  provisions  established  by  the  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  and  set out in Annexes to the Convention on International Civil Aviation to the ex-  tent  that  such  security  provisions  and  requirements  are  applicable  to  the  Con-  tracting  Parties.
銆€銆€銆€4.The  Contracting  Parties  shall  require  that  operators  of  aircraft  of  their registry  or  operators  of  aircraft  who  have  their.principal  place  of  business  or  permanent residence in their territory and the operators of airports in their terri-  tory act in conformity with such aviation security provisions.
鈥�12鈥�
銆€銆€銆€銆€5.Each  Contracting  Party  agrees  that  such  operators  of aircraft  may  be  re- quired to observe the aviation security provisions referred to in paragraph 3 and   4  above  required  by  the  other  Contracting  Party  for  entry  into,departure  from,  or  while  within  the  territory  of  that  other  Contracting  Party.Each  Contracting   Party  shall  ensure  that  adequate  measures  are  effectively  applied  within  its  ter-   ritory  to  protect  the  aircraft  and  to  inspect  passengers,crew,carry  -on  items,   baggage,cargo  and  aircraft  stores  prior  to  and  during  boarding  or  loading.   Each Contracting Party shall also give positive consideration to any request from   the  other  Contracting  Party  for  reasonable  special  security  measures  to  meet  a   particular   threat.
銆€銆€銆€6.When  an  incident  or  threat  of  an  incident  of  unlawful  seizure  of  civil aircraft  or  other  unlawful  acts  against  the  safety  of  such  aircraft,their  passen- gers  and  crew,airports  or  air  navigation  facilities  occurs,the  Contracting  Par- ties  shall  assist  each  other  by  facilitating  communications  and  other  appropriate measures intended to terminate such incident or threat thereof as rapidly as pos- sible  commensurate with minimum risk to  life.
銆€銆€銆€7.With  regard  to   aviation   security,the   aeronautical   authorities   of  either Contracting Party may request immediate consultations with the aeronautical au- thorities  of the  other  Contracting  Party.
銆€銆€銆€8.When  a  Contracting  Party  has  reasonable  grounds  to  believe  that  the other  Contracting  Party  has  departed  from  the  provisions  of  this  Article,the aeronautical  authorities  of  the  first  Contracting  Party  may  request  immediate consultations  with  the  aeronautical  authorities  of  the  other  Contracting  Party.  Failure  to  reach  a  satisfactory  agreement  within  fifteen(15)days  from  the  date of such request shall constitute grounds for the application of paragraph  1 of Ar- ticle   5(Revocation   and   Limitation   of  Authorization)of  this   Agreement.When
鈥� 13鈥�
required by  an  emergency,a  Contracting  Party  may  take  action  under  para- graph  1 of Article  5(Revocation and Limitation of Authorization)prior to the expiry  of  fifteen(15)days.Any.action   taken   in  accordance  with  this  para- graph shall be discontinued upon compliance by the other Contracting Party with the security provisions of this Article.

銆€銆€銆€銆€1.The charges imposed on a designated airline of one Contracting Party by the responsible charging bodies of the other Contracting Party for the use by  that designated airline of airport,airways and other civil aviation facilities and services shall not be higher than those imposed by such Contracting Party on any airline of other States engaged in similar international operations using sim- ilar aircraft and associated facilities and services.
銆€銆€銆€2.Each  Contracting  Party  shall  encourage  consultations  between  its  re- sponsible charging bodies and the designated airlines using the facilities and  services.Where  practicable,such  consultations  should  be  through  the  appro-  priate  representative  airline  organization.Reasonable  advance  notice  shall,  whenever  possible,be  given  to  the  designated  airlines  of  any  proposals  for  changes to charges referred to in this Article,together with relevant supporting information and data,to enable them to express and have their views taken into account before any changes are made.
銆€銆€銆€3.Neither  of  the  Contracting  Parties  shall  give  preference  to,or  permit responsible bodies to give preference to,its own or any other airline over a des-
